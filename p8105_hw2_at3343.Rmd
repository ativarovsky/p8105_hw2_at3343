# Problem 1

We are reading in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, stored as an excel file. We will also remove the last column, which contains notes. 
```{r data_frame1}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

mr_trash_data = read_excel("../data/mr_trash_dataset.xlsx")
mr_trash_data = janitor::clean_names(mr_trash_data)

# Removing last column of comments
mr_trash_data = select(mr_trash_data, -x15)
```

The "raw" dataframe contains 336 entries and 15 columns. 

We will now remove any rows that have dumpster = NA and convert the column "sports_balls" to an integer vector rounded to the nearest whole number. 

```{r data_frame2}

# Removing rows with "NA" for dumpster
mr_trash_data = drop_na(mr_trash_data, dumpster)

# Rounding sports_balls to nearest integer
mr_trash_data = mutate(mr_trash_data, sports_balls = round(as.integer(sports_balls, digits = 0)))

```
