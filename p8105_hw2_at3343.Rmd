#Problem 1

We are reading in and tidying the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, an excel file. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

mr_trash_data = read_excel("../data/mr_trash_dataset.xlsx",2)
mr_trash_data = janitor::clean_names(mr_trash_data)

```
