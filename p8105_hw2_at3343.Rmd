# Problem 1

We are reading in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, stored as an excel file. 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

mr_trash_data = read_excel("../data/mr_trash_dataset.xlsx")
mr_trash_data = janitor::clean_names(mr_trash_data)
```

The "raw" dataframe contains 336 entries and 15 columns. Now we want to remove the last column, which contains notes, and remove any rows that have dumpster = NA.
